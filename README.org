** Dismiss completion on iOS                                      :iOS:swift:
[2020-05-11 Mon]

Calling ~dismiss~ with a completion block on iOS 13 will cause the block to be run whether something needed to be dismissed or not, whilst on iOS 12 the block will not be run. Can be worked around by checking for the presence of a ~presentedViewController~.

** There is only the classpath                       :clojure:java:classpath:

Tools like [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] add concepts like ~:resources-path~ to help it figure out how to bundle thing and (has defaults by convention like the ~resources~ directory), but ultimately it all gets added to the classpath. The [[https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli][clojure cli]] only adds the ~src~ directory to the classpath by default, so when using code from a leiningen project as inspiration it's worth remembering that accessing resources won't work unless the appropriate paths are added to the ~:paths~ (or ~:extra-paths~ in aliases) property in the ~deps.edn~ file.

Example minimal deps.edn file:

#+begin_src clojure
  {:deps
   {;; maven/clojars lib
    clj-time {:mvn/version "0.14.2"}
    ;; local lib
    time-lib {:local/root "/path/to/time-lib"}
    ;; git lib
    github-yourname/time-lib {:git/url "https://github.com/yourname/time-lib"
			      :sha "04d2744549214b5cba04002b6875bdf59f9d88b6"}}
 
   :paths
   ["src", "resources"]

   :aliases
   {:test
    {:extra-paths
     ["test"]}}}
#+end_src
