** There is only the classpath                       :clojure:java:classpath:
[2020-05-06 Wed]

Tools like [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] add concepts like ~:resources-path~ to help it figure out how to bundle thing and (has defaults by convention like the ~resources~ directory), but ultimately it all gets added to the classpath. The [[https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli][clojure cli]] only adds the ~src~ directory to the classpath by default, so when using code from a leiningen project as inspiration it's worth remembering that accessing resources won't work unless the appropriate paths are added to the ~:paths~ (or ~:extra-paths~ in aliases) property in the ~deps.edn~ file.

Example minimal deps.edn file:

#+begin_src clojure
  {:deps
   {;; maven/clojars lib
    clj-time {:mvn/version "0.14.2"}
    ;; local lib
    time-lib {:local/root "/path/to/time-lib"}
    ;; git lib
    github-yourname/time-lib {:git/url "https://github.com/yourname/time-lib"
			      :sha "04d2744549214b5cba04002b6875bdf59f9d88b6"}}
 
   :paths
   ["src", "resources"]

   :aliases
   {:test
    {:extra-paths
     ["test"]}}}
#+end_src
